# DATABASE FILES
# ============================================

# Exclude LARGE production databases (1GB+)
App/database/stock_market_new.db
App/database/stock_market_backup_*.db

# EXCEPTION: Include minimal starter database (small, needed for deployment)
!App/database/stock_market_minimal.db

# Alternative pattern (achieves the same thing):
# If above doesn't work, comment it out and use this instead:
# App/database/*.db
# !App/database/stock_market_minimal.db
